# 👋 Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm a data scientist and bioinformatician with a strong background in biology and clinical research. I specialize in extracting insights from complex datasets—ranging from omics (RNA-seq, single-cell RNA-seq) to structured clinical data—using statistical modeling, machine learning, and data visualization techniques.

I enjoy turning data into actionable knowledge, especially in projects where science, health, and technology intersect.
