## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a PhD student in Clinical Research with specializations in Data Science and Data Analysis and a strong foundation in Bioinformatics. I come from a background in Biology, which led me to an interest in applying data science to healthcare and biological research. I'm interested in applying data-driven approaches to real-world problems, both within and beyond the life sciences.

ðŸ”­ **Currently working on**: 
- Mining large clinical and omic datasets (RNA-seq, single-cell RNA sequencing) to extract useful knowledge and inform decision-making.

ðŸŒ± **Currently learning**: 
- Exploring machine learning and advanced statistical analysis for data-driven healthcare and biological research applications.
- Developing my expertise in Data Science practices, including machine learning, statistical analysis, data wrangling, and visualization tools.
- Constantly striving to improve my Python, R, SQL, and statistical analysis skills to solve complex data problems with an emphasis on data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), predictive modeling, and machine learning.

ðŸ“« **How to reach me**: 
- Feel free to contact me via email or connect with me through my GitHub repositories. Iâ€™m always open to discussing new projects, potential collaborations, or sharing ideas about applying data science in the healthcare and life sciences sectors.

Thanks for visiting my profile! Let's connect and explore new ways to apply data science to biology and medicine! âœ¨
